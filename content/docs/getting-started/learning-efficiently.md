To get the most out of this course and to learn efficiently, we recommend 
the following practices:

### Watch the pre-lecture videos mindfully

A pre-lecture video is not just a recording of the lecture from a previous
semester.  The instructor designed them to be viewed before class.  As a result,
the content will be fast compared to a lecture with an audience.  Resist the
temptation to multitask and do the dishes or iron clothes while watching them.
(On the other hand, some students have reported that the lecture videos make a
good sleep aid.)  Also, we expect you will want to hit pause or rewind a section
once in a while; the ability to do so is a feature of the flipped classroom.

### Participate in the in-class activities

Section D3/D4 will use [POGIL](https://pogil.org) activities in class.  Section
B3/B4 will use the same activities, but without the POGIL roles.  CS students seem
accustomed to working alone on such things, but participating well in these group
activities has some advantages:
 - You will actually get to know other people in this class.
 - Explaining a concept to someone else is a great way to see if you actually know
   it as well as you think you do.
 - The "process skills" used in the group activities are highly sought after in
   industry.
   
### Start things early

Yeah, professors always say that, and it's true.  But I'm going to add some
nuance to it.  I'm not saying "don't wait until the deadline to turn it in."
You wouldn't listen to me if I said that anyway.  Instead, I want you to open
the assignment and check that you understand what it's asking of you, that you
have the files you need, etc.  If you wait until the day it's due to get started
you will have no recovery time if instructions are unclear or your computer goes
down.  So download the assignment early and at least start it to be sure
everything is as you expect, and then finish it when it seems best to you.
