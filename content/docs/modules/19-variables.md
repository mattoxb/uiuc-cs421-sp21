**Why this is important:**  Variables have four properties, and they can be
decided at run-time (dynamic binding) or at compile time (static binding).
Picking a language, or even a language construct, often requires you consider
these tradoffs.  Passing a parameter to a function can also be done in many
different ways, often in the same language.

## Outcomes
  - 19.1 -- Identify the four properties of variables and the effect of binding
  them statically or dynamically. (5 points)
  - 19.2 -- Show the effect of different parameter passing styles on a block of
  code. (5 points)
