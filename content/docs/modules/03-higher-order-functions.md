**Why this is important:**  Higher order functions are one of the major benefits
of functional programming.  Being able to assign functions to variables and pass
them into other functions allows you to parameterize  functionality rather than
hard code it.  Functions being able to create other functions gives you
tremendous flexibility in your programming.  These techniques are common now,
even in languages that are not considered to be functional, so it is likely you
will see them in industry.
