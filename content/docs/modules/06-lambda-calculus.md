**Why this is important:**  In order to reason about programming languages we need to be able to represent
functions and their behaviors mathematically.  Lambda calculus allows us to do that.

## Outcomes
  - 6.1 -- Given an expression, show the tree representation (1 point)
  - 6.2 -- Given a tree, show the corresponding expression (1 point)
  - 6.3 -- Given a redex, show a single beta reduction (1 point)
  - 6.4 -- Given a redex, show an alpha conversion (1 point)
  - 6.5 -- Given an expression, reduce to normal form.  (Expression will require both alpha and beta.)  (5 points)
  - 6.6 -- Write down a Church numeral for a specific number. (1 point)
