**Why this is important:**  The ability to define your own types is critical for a programming
language to be useful over time.  Arguably, the APL language died because it was not extensible.
We will use Haskell's datatype syntax extensively to represent programming languages.

## Outcomes

  - 2.1 -- Given reference code, write the corresponding datatype declaration (2 points) 
  - 2.2 -- Given a datatype declaration, write a recursive function that consumes the datatype. (2 points)
  - 2.3 -- Given a datatype declaration, write a recursive function that transforms the datatype (3 points)
  - 2.4 -- Given a datatype declaration, write a function that produces it from some other input. (3 points) 25%
