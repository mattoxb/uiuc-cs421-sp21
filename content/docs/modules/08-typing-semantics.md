**Why this is important:**  We have used semantics to discuss the meanings of programs,
but we can do more than that.  We can also use semantics to reason about the *type* of
an expression.  Even better, we can automate this process to allow the compiler to detect
errors &mdash; just like Haskell.

## Outcomes
  - 8.1 -- Given an expression, give a proof tree to prove its type. (Monotype) (5 points)
  - 8.2 -- Given an expression, give a proof tree to prove its type. (Polytype) (5 points)
