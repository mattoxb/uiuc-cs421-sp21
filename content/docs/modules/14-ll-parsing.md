**Why this is important:**  If a grammar is LL, it means you can implement it
simply, using no special tools to do so.  This can save a lot of time.
It also turns out that often a grammar that is not LL can be converted to an
equivalent one that is LL.

## Outcomes
  - 14.1 -- Given an LL grammar, give a corresponding parser in Haskell. (4 points)
  - 14.2 -- Identify whether a grammar is LL or not, and if not, convert it. (6 points)
