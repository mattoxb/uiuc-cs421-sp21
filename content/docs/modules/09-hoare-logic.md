**Why this is important:**  Sometimes you want to be able to demonstrate
that a program does what you wanted it to do, i.e., that it's *correct*.
Hoare Semantics is one way to do this.

## Outcomes
  - 9.1 -- Given two logic expressions, determine which is weaker and which is stronger. (2 point)
  - 9.2 -- Given a post-condition and an expression, derive the corresponding precondition. (4 points)
  - 9.3 -- Given a loop, derive a loop invariant and a post-condition. (4 points)
