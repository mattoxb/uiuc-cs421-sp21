**Why this is important:**  The first step to learning to write an interpreter
involves creating an appropriate data type and writing an evaluator.  Being able
to process simple expressions will enable you to add more flexibility to your
own software.

## Outcomes
  - 4.1 -- Given an implementation of `eval`, write a corresponding data type. (2 points)
  - 4.2 -- Given an implementation of `eval`, write a lifting function to allow
    Haskell functions to be used by the interpreter. (4 points)
  - 4.3 -- Given a datatype and semantics, write a clause of `eval` for `if` expressions, binary operations, or `let` expressions. (4 points)
