**Why this is important:**  Recursion is a foundational principle in both
mathematics and computer science.  It is the second most powerful concept in
computer science.  In our course, we will use recursive structures to define and
implement languages.  Further, there is a style of recursion called *tail
recursion* that a modern compiler can optimize to be a loop in machine code.

## Outcomes
  - 1.1 -- Write a recursive function over integers  (2 points)
  - 1.2 -- Write a mapping recursion over lists  (2 points)
  - 1.3 -- Write a folding recursion over lists  (2 points)
  - 1.4 -- Write a tail recursive function  (2 points)
  - 1.5 -- Indicate the advantage of tail recursion over direct style (MC) (2 points)
