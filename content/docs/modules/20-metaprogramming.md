**Why this is important:**  The third project I would not like to leave
unmentioned is LISP, a fascinating enterprise of a completely different nature.
With a few very basic principles at its foundation, it has shown a remarkable
stability. Besides that, LISP has been the carrier for a considerable number of
in a sense our most sophisticated computer applications. LISP has jokingly been
described as “the most intelligent way to misuse a computer”. I think that
description a great compliment because it transmits the full flavour of
liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in
thinking previously impossible thoughts.
