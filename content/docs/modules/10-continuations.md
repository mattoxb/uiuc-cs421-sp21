**Why this is important:**  Continuations allow us to manipulate the flow
of a program directly.  These are used in languages that lack threading or
exceptions to implement them, in compilers as part of an optimization
sequence, and in GUI application, where they are called "callbacks".

## Outcomes
  - 10.1 -- Compare and contrast continuations and tail recursion. (MC) (2 point)
  - 10.2 -- Convert a given recursive function to continuation passing style
     using the provided CPS transform. (8 points)
